Hooks are special functions in React that let you "hook into" React's features. They allow you to use state and other React features in functional components, which were previously only possible in class components.
Before hooks, if you wanted to use state or lifecycle methods, you had to use class components. Hooks let you use these features in functional components, making your code simpler and more reusable.
