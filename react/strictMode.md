Strict Mode in React is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It helps you write cleaner, more efficient, and future-proof React code by identifying components and practices that might cause issues.


```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

``` 

Benefits of Using Strict Mode:

рез. Early Detection of Potential Issues: By identifying potential problems early in development, you can fix them before they affect your production code.
реи. Future-Proofing: It helps ensure your code is compliant with future React updates, making your application more maintainable in the long run.
рей. Improved Best Practices: Encourages adherence to best practices, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.
